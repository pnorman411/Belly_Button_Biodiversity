# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created through the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  The data used includes volunteers, their demographic information, and results from their bacterial specimens.  

JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js was used to create a horizontal bar chart that displayed the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs), a gauge that displayed the number of washings/scrubs per week, and a bubble chart that displayed the bacteria cultures per sample with the use of hovermode to display the details when hovering over each bubble.
